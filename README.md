# MicrohapDB (HaploSearch)

A comprehensive web application for managing and analyzing microhaplotype genetic data, designed for researchers and institutions working with population genetics and genomic analysis.

## üß¨ What is MicrohapDB?

MicrohapDB is a specialized database system for storing, managing, and analyzing **microhaplotypes** - short DNA sequences that contain multiple closely linked polymorphic sites. These genetic markers are valuable for:

- **Population genetics studies**
- **Ancestry inference**
- **Forensic genetics**
- **Evolutionary research**
- **Biogeographical analysis**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### üåê Frontend (Vue.js)
**Location**: `microhapDB-frontend/`

A modern, responsive web interface built with Vue.js that provides:

- **Data Upload & Management**: Upload PAV (Presence/Absence Variation) and MADC (Microhaplotype Allele Data Collection) files
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for genetic data analysis
- **User Authentication**: ORCID-based login system for researchers
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrative tools for data management
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced search capabilities across genetic datasets

**Key Features**:
- Real-time data validation during upload
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Export functionality for analysis results
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- Integration with ORCID for researcher authentication

### üîß Backend (FastAPI)
**Location**: `microhapDB-backend/`

A robust REST API built with FastAPI and Python that handles:

- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL database with optimized schemas
- **File Processing**: Handles PAV and MADC file formats with validation
- **Authentication**: ORCID OAuth integration
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical computations and genetic analysis algorithms
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and caching for large datasets

**Key Features**:
- RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints
- Database migrations with Alembic
- Background task processing
- Data validation and error handling
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Docker containerization for deployment
